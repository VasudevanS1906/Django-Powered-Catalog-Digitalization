# Django-Powered-Catalog-Digitalization
 This Django project deployed on PythonAnywhere offers a comprehensive solution for digitizing catalogs using multiple modes of input. Users can input text, text in Indic languages, voice recordings in multiple languages, and utilize optical character recognition (OCR) for images. The system also supports a combination of image-text and audio modes for enhanced data capture. Additionally, users can easily view all digitized records through a user-friendly interface, making it a versatile tool for efficient catalog management.

# Input Modes

## Text Mode:
In the text mode of this catalog digitization system, users input SKU ID, product name, price, count, and attach an image. The system then processes this information to digitize the catalog, ensuring efficient and accurate conversion of the data for catalog management.

## Text Indic Mode
The text Indic mode supports input in multiple languages, including Marathi, Tamil, and Hindi. This mode allows healthcare providers to input patient data in their preferred language, making the system more accessible and user-friendly.

## Voice Mode
The voice mode enables users to input data where the system read aloud the input fields through voice commands in English languages. This mode is ideal for healthcare providers who prefer to use voice commands or who have limited access to manual data entry or image recognition technology.

## Voice Indic Mode
The voice Indic feature reads aloud the input fields in Indic languages, providing better accessibility for healthcare providers who are visually impaired or have difficulty reading text.

## Image Mode: 
Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract data from images, making it easier to digitize physical records.

## Flexible Combination: 
Supports a combination of all five modes, providing flexibility for users to choose the best input method based on their needs.

## View Records Mode:
The view-all-records feature enables healthcare providers to access and view all patient health records in one place. This feature is ideal for healthcare providers who want to access patient data quickly and efficiently.
